1- install the dependencies by typing :

    pip install -r requirements.txt 

on the root path of the project 

2- change the value of the executable (line 203) into the path of the executable of your executable 
in most case it'll be "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" in windows or "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" in linux
